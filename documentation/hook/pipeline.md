# Hook Pipeline

Each incoming prompt passes through these stages in order. Any stage can short-circuit to an empty response.

## Stage 1 — Skip Heuristics

Prompts that carry no useful search signal are rejected immediately — no embedding, no DB call.

Skipped if:
- Prompt is null or blank
- Prompt starts with `!nomem` (explicit opt-out)
- Prompt is in the meta-phrase list (`ok`, `ja`, `danke`, `wie geht's`, `alles klar`, …)
- Prompt is a pure code block (starts and ends with ` ``` `)
- Fewer than 5 words
- Starts with a social phrase (`wie geht `, `wie läuft `, `hallo`, `guten morgen`, …) and has ≤ 8 words

Force-include: prefix prompt with `!mem ` to bypass all skip logic.

## Stage 2 — Embedding + Search

The prompt is embedded via the configured embedding model (`paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2`) and passed to `ranked_search` — a PostgreSQL function combining five signals:

| Signal | Default weight | What it measures |
|---|---|---|
| `score_semantic` | 0.30 | Cosine similarity between prompt and cell embeddings |
| `score_keyword` | 0.15 | Full-text match (tsvector) |
| `score_recency` | 0.15 | How recently the cell was created |
| `score_importance` | 0.15 | Manually assigned importance (1–5) |
| `score_popularity` | 0.15 | Access frequency |
| `score_graph_proximity` | 0.10 | Distance via tunnel graph |

`ranked_search` applies a hard pre-filter: `score_semantic > 0.3 OR score_keyword > 0`. Results are ordered by `score_total` descending.

## Stage 3 — Relevance Threshold

```
score_total >= relevanceThreshold  (default: 0.65)
```

Cells below this threshold are discarded. Tunable via `hivemem.hooks.relevance-threshold` or the `?threshold=` query param.

## Stage 4 — Semantic Floor

```
score_semantic >= minSemanticScore  (default: 0.35)
```

Prevents pure keyword matches from being injected. A cell that matches on keyword overlap alone (e.g. "deployment" appearing in both prompt and cell) without semantic similarity is filtered out here.

This addresses the failure mode where a topically unrelated cell scores high due to shared vocabulary.

## Stage 5 — Session Dedup

Cells already injected within the last `dedupWindowTurns` turns (default: 5) in the same session are suppressed. Avoids repeating context Claude has already seen.

## Stage 6 — CWD Promotion

If the request includes a `cwd` (current working directory), the last path component is extracted (e.g. `/root/hivemem` → `hivemem`). Cells whose `realm`, `topic`, or `tags` contain this string are sorted to the front, even if their `score_total` is lower than other results.

This is a soft promotion — it reorders results but does not filter. A configurable hard realm filter is planned (see [roadmap](roadmap.md)).
