### Attachment ingestion

Each file upload (via `upload_attachment` or `POST /api/attachments`) automatically creates a new `pending` Cell. For PDF files, the page count is determined at ingest (via Apache PDFBox) and stored in `attachments.page_count` (INTEGER, `null` for non-PDF types). This field is exposed in the `get_cell` `attachments[]` list, `get_attachment_info`, and `list_attachments` responses. The cell content is set to the text extracted from the file; if no text could be extracted, the original filename is used as a fallback. The Classifier agent picks up `pending` cells asynchronously and enriches them with summary, key points, insight, and tags. The link between the attachment and its extraction cell is recorded in `cell_attachments` with `extraction_source = true`. If the caller also supplies an existing `cell_id`, a `related_to` tunnel is created between the new extraction Cell and the supplied cell.

### Document enrichment — summarizer output fields

The summarizer LLM is called once per ingested document. In addition to the narrative layers (summary, key points, insight) it now emits two additional structured fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `language` | ISO 639-1 string | Detected content language (e.g. `de`, `en`). Empty/null if the LLM cannot determine it. |
| `tax_relevant` | boolean | Whether the document is relevant for tax purposes (invoices, receipts, contracts with financial implications, etc.). |

**Tax tagging:** When `tax_relevant` is `true`, the enrichment pipeline applies a language-correct tag to the cell:

| Content language | Tag applied |
|---|---|
| `en` | `tax-relevant` |
| `de` (or unknown / blank) | `steuerrelevant` |

Unknown or blank language falls back to the instance default language (`HIVEMEM_LANGUAGE`, default `de`), so the fallback tag is `steuerrelevant` on a standard German-language instance.

**Document date → `valid_from`:** The extraction profiles (invoice, contract, other, image-document-scan) request a `document_date` fact from the LLM. If the fact is present, it is parsed by `DocumentDateParser`:

- Accepted formats: `YYYY-MM-DD` (strict ISO), `YYYY-MM` (expanded to first of month), `YYYY` (expanded to Jan 1).
- Plausibility window: `1970-01-01` … today + 1 day. Values outside the window are discarded.
- When a valid date is parsed, the cell's `valid_from` is set to that date so that timeline views and sort-by-date reflect the document's own date rather than the ingest timestamp.

### Image EXIF & geolocation

Image attachments (`image/*`) get a row in `attachment_image_meta` (1:0..1 with
`attachments`, only images get a row), populated synchronously at ingest by
`ExifExtractor` (the `metadata-extractor` library): pixel `width`/`height`, capture
date (`taken_at` from EXIF `DateTimeOriginal`, interpreted as UTC — EXIF carries no
timezone, so cross-timezone sort order can be off by the local UTC offset), `camera_make`/
`camera_model`, GPS `gps_lat`/`gps_lon`, and EXIF `orientation`. Thumbnails are rotated
upright per the EXIF orientation flag. EXIF failures never abort ingest.

When GPS coordinates are present, ingest publishes a `GeocodeRequestedEvent` and
`GeocodingService` (async, `@TransactionalEventListener` AFTER_COMMIT) reverse-geocodes them to a `place_name`
("City, CC") via a Nominatim endpoint, caching by rounded coordinates and throttling to
≤1 request/second. The resolution state is tracked in `geocode_status`
(`none` | `pending` | `done` | `failed`).

A one-time idempotent startup backfill (`ImageMetaBackfillRunner`) populates metadata for
images uploaded before this feature existed. The `list_media` MCP tool reads this table
for the photo gallery.

Configuration (`hivemem.geocoding.*`):

| Property | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `hivemem.geocoding.enabled` | `true` | Master switch for reverse-geocoding |
| `hivemem.geocoding.base-url` | `https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org` | Reverse-geocode endpoint |
| `hivemem.geocoding.user-agent` | `HiveMem/1.0 (+https://github.com/visterion/hivemem)` | Required by Nominatim usage policy |

### Saved searches

The `saved_searches` table persists named filter presets for the Scans explorer UI. Each row belongs to an `owner` (token name) and stores the filter state as a `JSONB` blob. Soft-deletion is handled via `valid_until`; active rows have `valid_until IS NULL`. An index on `(owner) WHERE valid_until IS NULL` keeps lookups fast per user.

### Embedding dependency for OCR'd documents

OCR'd scan documents are typically long, and `EmbeddingClient.encodeForCell` returns `null` for content over 500 characters that has no summary yet. So a long scanned cell gets **no embedding at ingest/OCR time**: `WriteToolService.reviseCell` tags it `needs_summary`, and the scheduled summarizer backfill (every 5 min) generates the summary and only then re-embeds the cell. Short documents (≤500 chars) are embedded immediately at OCR time.

### Content dedup (re-scans)

Content-based dedup runs **after** the cell's embedding exists, so it can rely on pgvector recall:

- **Long documents:** dedup runs in `SummarizerService.summarizeOne`, once the summary has been generated and the cell re-embedded.
- **Short documents (≤500 chars):** the embedding is available immediately, so dedup runs at OCR time in `OcrService`.

`DocumentDedupService.findAndDiscardDuplicate` runs a two-stage check against current committed scan cells, and only ever discards cells whose `source` starts with `consumption:`: pgvector cosine recall (`recall-threshold`) then a normalized character-4-gram Jaccard gate (`text-threshold`). A confirmed re-scan (matching a strictly older cell) is soft-deleted, its attachment binary is removed if no other live cell references it, and a `duplicate_of` tunnel links it to the original. The check is best-effort: any error keeps the document. Note: byte-identical re-uploads are already deduped earlier by SHA-256 in `AttachmentService.ingest`; this step covers same-content/different-bytes re-scans.

Configuration (`hivemem.consumption.dedup.*`):

| Property | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `hivemem.consumption.dedup.enabled` | `true` | Enable content dedup of re-scanned documents |
| `hivemem.consumption.dedup.recall-threshold` | `0.92` | Cosine floor for HNSW candidate recall |
| `hivemem.consumption.dedup.text-threshold` | `0.85` | Jaccard floor confirming a duplicate |
| `hivemem.consumption.dedup.candidate-k` | `10` | Max HNSW candidates checked |

### Per-document confidence aggregate

The `facts` table has a `REAL confidence` column (range `[0, 1]`). The `get_cell` tool exposes a `confidence` optional field (requested via `include=['confidence']`) that is computed as `AVG(confidence) FROM active_facts WHERE source_id = cell.id`. The same aggregate is available in `list_documents` rows. Both return `null` when a cell has no active facts.

### Subject canonicalization (`kg_entity`)

Free-text `subject` values on `facts` fragment easily ("Acme Inc." vs "Acme" vs "ACME"), which defeats supersede/contradiction detection since it only compares within a single `(subject, predicate)` group. The `kg_entity` table (`id uuid` PK, `canonical_name text` unique/not-null, `aliases text[]`) is an alias registry populated via the `kg_alias` tool: it stores a canonical subject string plus its known alternate spellings, and retro-migrates any existing facts recorded under an alias onto the canonical subject (invalidate + re-add, preserving `valid_from`).

Once an alias is registered, subject resolution runs on both sides of the KG API: on the write path, `kg_add` resolves its incoming `subject` through the registry before insert, so a fact written under a known alias lands on the canonical subject automatically; on the read path, `entity_overview` and `quick_facts` resolve a queried subject the same way, so looking up any alias surfaces the canonical entity's facts. The `pg_trgm` extension (added alongside `kg_entity` in migration V0038) powers `data_quality_report`'s `potential_conflicts` section, which flags predicates with multiple distinct active subjects and ranks candidate subject pairs by trigram similarity — the discovery half of the canonicalization workflow, paired with `kg_alias` as the fix.

**Limitation:** the `kg_entity` alias registry itself is not propagated via the op-log/sync stream — only the resulting fact invalidate/add ops from `kg_alias`'s retro-migration are synced. On a multi-instance deployment, a peer whose registry hasn't been separately synced would not canonicalize its own new writes through that alias. Current production is single-instance, so this is a known follow-up rather than an active bug.

## Security & Capability Matrix

Every HiveMem tool is mapped to a specific role to ensure least privilege. Write operations (excluding agents) and admin functions are protected by RBAC.

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Search** | `search`, `search_kg`, `quick_facts`, `time_machine`, `facet_count` | `reader` | Read Only | No | 6-signal semantic & keyword search. `search` supports optional `tags` (match-ANY array) and `status` filters. `facet_count` returns aggregate counts grouped by `tag`/`status`/`realm`/`year`/`signal`, plus `fact:<predicate>` fields (allow-listed: `vendor`, `party`, `amount_total`, `value_per_period`, `document_date`, `due_date`, `invoice_number`, `contract_number`). |
| **Read** | `status`, `get_cell`, `list`, `traverse`, `wake_up`, `get_blueprint`, `history`, `pending_approvals`, `reading_list`, `list_agents`, `diary_read`, `list_attachments`, `get_attachment_info`, `list_saved_searches`, `list_media` | `reader` | Read Only | No | Navigation and context retrieval. `get_cell` supports `include=['confidence']` for the per-document average fact confidence (nullable). |

### `ranked_search` PostgreSQL function

The `ranked_search` stored function powers the `search` tool. It is **not** managed by Flyway; instead it is recreated on every startup by `EmbeddingMigrationService` from an in-code template. This is intentional — the function signature must stay in sync with the embedding vector dimension, which can change between deployments. As of SP-C1 the function accepts the optional parameters `p_tags TEXT[]` (match-ANY array overlap filter) and `p_status TEXT` (filter by cell status, default `committed`).

### Search weights, profiles, and confidence

`search` combines six signals (semantic, keyword, recency, importance, popularity, graph_proximity) into a `score_total`. The weight vector is chosen by the `profile` param — a fixed preset (`balanced` (default) | `semantic` | `recent` | `important` | `keyword`), where `balanced` equals the baseline `hivemem.search.weights` defaults. The legacy per-call `weight_*` params are soft-deprecated but still override individual weights when present.

`confidence_level` is computed **relative to the returned result-set**, not against absolute cutoffs. For each query, the mean and population standard deviation (`sigma`) of the returned hits' `score_total` values are computed once, then each hit is classified: `NONE` if `score_total` is below the absolute floor `hivemem.search.confidence.floor` (default `0.20`) or the result-set has fewer than 2 elements; `HIGH` if `score_total >= mean + sigma`; `LOW` if `score_total < mean`; `MEDIUM` otherwise (including when `sigma == 0` across the above-floor hits). The former absolute `hivemem.search.confidence.high`/`medium`/`low` properties have been removed. Both `score_total` and `confidence_level` are always returned; the five per-signal sub-scores are returned only when the caller passes `include=['scores']`.

### Facts embedding & semantic `search_kg`

`facts` carries a nullable `embedding vector` column (V0037), mirroring the cells lifecycle: `EmbeddingStateRepository.createFactsEmbeddingIndex`/`dropFactsEmbeddingIndex` manage an `idx_facts_embedding` HNSW index (cosine ops) whose dimension is (re)bound at startup by `EmbeddingMigrationService`, and a model/dimension change triggers a full facts re-encode alongside the existing cells re-encode. `active_facts` is a `SELECT *` view, so V0037 dropped and recreated it to carry the new column through.

On write, `WriteToolService.kgAdd`/`reviseFact` embed `subject + " " + predicate + " " + object` via `embeddingClient.encodeDocument(...)` and store the vector; embedding failures are caught and logged, never fail the fact write (the fact is stored with `embedding = NULL`). `EmbeddingBackfillService` runs a parallel facts pass (alongside its existing cells pass) that finds committed, active facts with `embedding IS NULL` and encodes them in the background.

`search_kg` gained an optional `query` param: when present, `ReadToolService.searchKg` embeds it via `encodeQuery` and calls `KgSearchRepository.semanticSearch`, which ranks `active_facts` by cosine distance (`embedding <=> query`) and returns a `score` field (`1 - cosine_distance`) alongside the usual triple fields; the existing `subject`/`predicate`/`object_` ILIKE filters still narrow the semantic result set. If embedding the query fails (or returns `null`), it falls back to the original ILIKE-only `search` path. Calling `search_kg` without `query` is unchanged.

## Security & Compliance

- **Privacy First:** HiveMem is 100% self-hosted. Your data never leaves your infrastructure.
- **Auditability:** All tool calls and authentication events are logged to `/data/audit.log`.
- **SafeSkill Score:** **100/100 (Verified Safe)**. See [SafeSkill Report](https://safeskill.dev/scan/visterion-hivemem).
- **Transparency:** 7/7 points. See [SAFE.md](../SAFE.md) for the security manifest.
- **Human-in-the-Loop:** All agent writes require manual approval via `approve_pending`.

## Vistierie Integration (Queen + Bees)

HiveMem delegates agent scheduling and subagent dispatch to **Vistierie** — the agent runtime running on the LXC host. HiveMem is already a Vistierie tenant (used for `/llm/*` summarizer and vision calls); the Queen + Bees feature reuses that tenancy.

### Outbound: agent registration

On startup (when `hivemem.queen.enabled=true`), `VistierieAgentBootstrap` (in `com.hivemem.queen`) performs idempotent `PUT`/`POST` calls to Vistierie's `/agents` endpoint via `VistierieAgentClient`, registering two agent definitions:

- **`isolated-cell-bee`** — subagent; finds cells with no tunnels and proposes candidate connections.
- **`queen`** — cron agent; surveys knowledge and dispatches the Bee on a configurable schedule.

HiveMem authenticates these calls with the existing `HIVEMEM_VISTIERIE_TOKEN` (the same credential used for LLM calls).

### Inbound: `/vistierie/**` callbacks

Vistierie calls back into HiveMem over the `hivemem-net` Docker network via three endpoint groups:

| Path | Auth header | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /vistierie/tools/find_isolated_cells` | `hivemem.queen.webhook-token` | Returns cells that have no outbound tunnels |
| `POST /vistierie/tools/read_cell` | `hivemem.queen.webhook-token` | Returns full cell detail for a given cell ID |
| `POST /vistierie/tools/search_similar_cells` | `hivemem.queen.webhook-token` | Returns cells semantically related to the given cell across all realms (excluding the cell itself) |
| `POST /vistierie/runs/done` | `hivemem.queen.completion-webhook-token` | Receives the Queen's aggregated output and writes each proposal as a `pending` tunnel |

All four endpoints live under `/vistierie/**`, which is **exempt from the global `AuthFilter` and `SessionAuthFilter`**. Each request is authenticated by a constant-time bearer-token check against the respective config property.

### Write isolation

HiveMem remains the **sole writer**. The Bee only proposes; `POST /vistierie/runs/done` ingests the aggregated proposals and inserts each as a `pending` tunnel. Those entries then flow through the existing approval workflow (`approve_pending`) before any change is committed to the knowledge graph.

### Audit / scheduling / kill switch

Scheduling (cron ticks), subagent dispatch (context-shielding), per-run cost accounting, and the per-tenant kill switch are all **owned by Vistierie** — stored in its `runs` and `llm_calls` tables, not duplicated in HiveMem. To halt all Queen/Bee activity, issue `POST /admin/tenants/hivemem/kill` on the Vistierie admin API.

> **Budget requirement:** The Vistierie tenant and each agent must have a daily/monthly budget set, or every cron tick returns 403. See the [Operations runbook](operations.md#queen--bees-on-vistierie-lxc-102) for the setup commands.

### HiveMem → Vistierie task dispatch (new direction)

The consumption pipeline is the **first instance of HiveMem initiating a
Vistierie run** rather than merely registering agents and waiting for Vistierie
to call back. When a multi-page PDF arrives in the consumption folder,
`VistierieSeparationClient` POSTs directly to
`/agents/document-separator/run`, supplying the page digests inside the run
`payload` and a `completion_webhook` URL that Vistierie calls when the
separation run finishes. HiveMem stores the returned `run_id` to correlate that
callback.

This establishes a new request/response pattern on top of the existing
callback-based integration:

| Direction | Mechanism | Who initiates |
|---|---|---|
| Agent registration | PUT/POST `/agents` | HiveMem (startup) |
| Tool calls during a run | POST `/vistierie/tools/**` | Vistierie (inbound) |
| Queen completion | POST `/vistierie/runs/done` | Vistierie (inbound) |
| **Task dispatch (new)** | **POST `/agents/{name}/run`** | **HiveMem (outbound, on demand)** |
| Separation result | POST `/vistierie/separation/done` | Vistierie (inbound) |

The intended long-term direction is for **all generative LLM work to live in
Vistierie** — models, budgets, scheduling, and audit traces owned there — while
HiveMem retains only local embedding inference. The consumption pipeline's
dispatch pattern is the first step toward that model.

### Queen-Log UI

The Queen-Log UI lets admins inspect past Queen and Bee runs without leaving HiveMem. The data path is:

1. The UI calls the `queen_runs` (list) or `queen_run_detail` (single run) MCP tools — both are **admin-only**.
2. Those tools delegate to `QueenRunsService`, which calls `VistierieRunsClient`.
3. `VistierieRunsClient` first attempts `GET /admin/runs` on Vistierie using the optional `HIVEMEM_QUEEN_VISTIERIE_ADMIN_TOKEN`. This admin endpoint includes per-run cost accounting (`llmCalls`, `costMicros`). If no admin token is configured, it falls back to the tenant-scoped `GET /runs` endpoint (same `HIVEMEM_VISTIERIE_TOKEN` used for LLM calls), which returns the same run list but without cost fields.
4. For run detail, `VistierieRunsClient` calls the tenant endpoint `GET /runs/{id}` for run metadata and `GET /runs/{id}/events` for the Vistierie event timeline; these are combined into the `queen_run_detail` response.
5. The approval queue shown alongside run history reuses the existing `pending_approvals` and `approve_pending` tools — no new endpoints or DB tables are required.

On a Vistierie outage, both tools degrade gracefully: `queen_runs` returns `{items:[],total:0,costAvailable:false,unavailable:true}` and `queen_run_detail` returns `{run:{},events:[],unavailable:true}`, allowing the UI to display an appropriate offline notice.

## Language / i18n

The UI is bilingual (German + English), German-first. The startup default language
comes from a global backend property `hivemem.language` (env `HIVEMEM_LANGUAGE`,
default `de`), delivered to the SPA in the `wake_up` response as `default_language`.
The user can switch language in Settings; that choice is stored in `localStorage`
(`hivemem_locale`) and overrides the backend default on subsequent visits.

The summarizer's output-language default inherits the same global value
(`hivemem.summarize.language` defaults to `${HIVEMEM_LANGUAGE}`), but keeps its own
override `HIVEMEM_SUMMARIZE_LANGUAGE`.

## Admin backfill endpoints

One-shot idempotent endpoints (all require the `admin` role) for retroactively enriching
existing documents without re-deploying or re-ingesting files.

| Endpoint | Query param | Response fields | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POST /admin/backfill-titles` | `limit` (default 200) | `titled` | Give already-summarized documents that have no topic/title a short LLM-generated title. |
| `POST /admin/backfill-tax-date` | `limit` (default 200) | `processed` | Set `valid_from` from an existing stored `document_date` fact and apply the appropriate tax tag (`steuerrelevant` / `tax-relevant`) via a cheap summary-only classifier. Cells without a stored `document_date` fact are **not** re-extracted from full text (too expensive); only the tax tag is backfilled for those. Idempotent: processed cells receive the marker tag `tax_scanned` and are skipped on subsequent runs. |
| `POST /admin/dedup-backfill` | — | `checked`, `discarded` | Retro-dedup existing scans: walks live `consumption:`-sourced cells oldest→newest and discards re-scans found via `DocumentDedupService`. **Run only after embeddings have been backfilled** — give the startup `needs_summary` tagging plus one cycle of the 5-min summarizer first, otherwise long scans have no embedding to match on. |

The summarizer-dependent endpoints (`backfill-titles`, `backfill-tax-date`) return HTTP 503 `{"error":"summarizer disabled"}` when the summarizer bean is not available (i.e. `HIVEMEM_VISTIERIE_URL` is unset).

### Self-healing embedding backfill

On startup, `SummarizeBackfillStartupRunner` tags any live committed cell with `embedding IS NULL AND length(content) > 500` as `needs_summary`. The scheduled summarizer (every 5 min) then summarizes and re-embeds those cells. This restores semantic search for scans that previously missed their embedding (e.g. ingested before the embedding-dependency fix).

### Consumption pipeline — error handling & recovery

The consumption pipeline is designed to tolerate transient failures without data loss and without operator intervention.

**Embedding client resilience.** `EmbeddingClient` uses a configurable timeout (default 30 s) and retry-with-exponential-backoff (default 3 retries, 500 ms base). If all retries are exhausted the client throws, and the ingest path commits the cell **without an embedding**, tagging it `embedding_pending`. Embeddings are therefore nullable — their absence never blocks ingestion.

**Embedding backfill sweep.** `EmbeddingBackfillService` runs on a fixed schedule (default every 5 min) and finds all committed cells tagged `embedding_pending`. Once the embedding service is healthy again it backfills them in configurable batches (default 50 per cycle) and removes the tag. Semantic search is restored automatically — no operator action needed.

**Exactly-once file staging via the `consumption_file` ledger.** Every file the watcher picks up is recorded in the `consumption_file` table with its SHA-256 content hash. State transitions: `processing` → `done` (committed) or `processing` → `failed` (ingest error). The `attempts` counter increments on each try. Content-based dedup (`DocumentDedupService`) means re-queuing an already-committed file is safe — the second ingest is discarded as a duplicate.

**Reassembly partial-ingest → `failed/`.** When a multi-page PDF is separated into sub-documents by Vistierie and at least one sub-document fails to ingest, the entire batch is moved to `failed/`. Previously, remaining sub-documents would be silently dropped. With the ledger and the retry sweep, the whole batch can be re-attempted safely after the root cause is resolved.

**Recovery sweep.** `ConsumptionRecoverySweep` runs at startup and on a fixed interval (default 5 min) and handles two cases:

- Files crash-stranded in `processing` past the stale threshold (default 30 min) are re-staged — these are files that were mid-ingest when the JVM was killed.
- Files in `failed/` with an attempt count below the retry limit (default 3) are moved back to the watch root for re-ingest. Files that exhaust the retry limit remain in `failed/` and require manual inspection.
