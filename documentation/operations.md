# Operations

## Backups

For full instance portability (Postgres + SeaweedFS attachments + manifest in one tar.gz, with `--mode=move` and `--mode=clone` restore), use the dedicated backup CLI documented in [Backup + Portability](backup.md). Quick form:

```bash
java -jar app.jar --spring.profiles.active=backup \
    backup export --out /var/lib/hivemem/exports/backup.tar.gz
```

For a quick Postgres-only safety net (no attachments, no manifest), the raw `pg_dump` route is still available — but `backup.md` is the canonical mechanism for disaster recovery and host migration:

```bash
# Postgres-only quick dump (no attachments)
docker exec hivemem-db pg_dump -U hivemem hivemem | gzip > "hivemem-$(date +%Y%m%d).sql.gz"
```

The Postgres-only dump alone is **not** sufficient if attachments are enabled — the `attachments` table references SeaweedFS objects by S3 key.

## Run Tests

Tests use [Testcontainers](https://java.testcontainers.org/) — a `pgvector/pgvector:pg17` container is started and destroyed per session. Embeddings are stubbed with a fixed test client (deterministic vectors, no external service needed).

```bash
cd java-server
mvn test
```

The exact test count changes over time; use the CI badge and workflow runs as the current source of truth.

## Deploy Changes

Deployment is compose-based. `docker-compose.yml` wires the services together on the
`hivemem-net` network (`hivemem-db`, `hivemem-embeddings`, `seaweedfs`, `hivemem` on
port `8421`) and has **no committed secret defaults** — put the secrets in a `.env`
file next to the compose file (gitignored):

```bash
# .env (next to docker-compose.yml)
HIVEMEM_DB_PASSWORD=<strong password>
SEAWEEDFS_S3_ACCESS_KEY=<access key>
SEAWEEDFS_S3_SECRET_KEY=<secret key>
```

The SeaweedFS credentials must match `seaweedfs/s3.json`, which you create once from
`seaweedfs/s3.json.template` (the real file is gitignored).

**Local build + deploy** (builds the image from source via the multi-stage Dockerfile,
then recreates the stack — dependencies come up first via their healthchecks):

```bash
./deploy.sh java
```

The script builds the image, runs `docker compose up -d`, and waits for HTTP 200 on
`http://localhost:8421/login`. To roll back, `docker compose up -d` with the previously
working image (compose pins the image name; earlier builds remain in the local image
store under their image IDs).

**Production** pulls a pinned release tag (e.g. `9.3.0`) from GHCR instead of building —
bump the tag in the production compose file and `docker compose pull && docker compose
up -d hivemem`.

## Migrations

Schema changes are managed by [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/). Migrations run automatically at Spring Boot application startup.

Migration files live in `java-server/src/main/resources/db/migration/` using the Flyway naming convention (`V0001__description.sql`, `V0002__description.sql`, etc.).

To add a new migration:

```bash
cat > java-server/src/main/resources/db/migration/V0009__my_feature.sql << 'EOF'
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS my_table (...);
EOF
```

Deploy the application — Flyway applies pending migrations on startup.

## Enabling OAuth (MCP Custom Connectors)

HiveMem's OAuth 2.0 authorization server (used by Claude.ai / ChatGPT Custom Connectors) is
**disabled by default**. While `HIVEMEM_OAUTH_ENABLED` is `false`, all `/oauth/*` and
`/.well-known/oauth-*` endpoints return `404`. A non-blank `HIVEMEM_OAUTH_ISSUER` is
additionally required for OAuth to *function* — with `enabled=true` but a blank issuer the
discovery documents return `200` with an empty issuer and the `/mcp` `WWW-Authenticate`
header is suppressed, so the connector flow will not work. For the full connector flow and
security model see [OAuth 2.0 + Custom Connector Setup](oauth.md).

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `HIVEMEM_OAUTH_ENABLED` | `false` | Set to `true` to activate the OAuth endpoints |
| `HIVEMEM_OAUTH_ISSUER` | *(empty)* | The **public HTTPS origin** the server is reached at |

`HIVEMEM_OAUTH_ISSUER` **must** be the public HTTPS origin (e.g. `https://mem.example.com`),
not the internal container URL. It flows verbatim into the discovery metadata (`issuer`,
`authorization_endpoint`, `token_endpoint`, …) and into the `iss` of issued tokens, so any
mismatch fails client-side validation.

Add both under the `hivemem` service's `environment:` block in `/opt/hivemem/docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  hivemem:
    environment:
      HIVEMEM_OAUTH_ENABLED: "true"
      HIVEMEM_OAUTH_ISSUER: "https://mem.example.com"
```

Recreate only the `hivemem` service (this is an outward-facing change — get explicit
authorization first):

```bash
cd /opt/hivemem && docker compose up -d hivemem
```

Verify the discovery endpoint responds with the configured issuer:

```bash
curl -s https://mem.example.com/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server | jq .issuer
# → "https://mem.example.com"   (HTTP 200)
```

If OAuth is disabled, this returns `404`.

## Attachment Storage (SeaweedFS)

Attachment storage is optional. Set `HIVEMEM_ATTACHMENT_ENABLED=true` to enable.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `HIVEMEM_ATTACHMENT_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable attachment storage |
| `SEAWEEDFS_S3_ENDPOINT` | `http://localhost:8333` | SeaweedFS S3 API endpoint |
| `SEAWEEDFS_S3_BUCKET` | `hivemem-attachments` | S3 bucket name |
| `SEAWEEDFS_S3_ACCESS_KEY` | *(empty — required)* | S3 access key; must match `seaweedfs/s3.json` |
| `SEAWEEDFS_S3_SECRET_KEY` | *(empty — required)* | S3 secret key; must match `seaweedfs/s3.json` |

### Backup

The `seaweedfs_data` Docker volume must be backed up together with the PostgreSQL dump. The `attachments` table references objects by their S3 keys — a DB backup without the volume (or vice versa) results in broken references.

### Deployment

SeaweedFS is included in `docker-compose.yml` as a sidecar service. Create
`seaweedfs/s3.json` from `seaweedfs/s3.json.template` with the same credentials you set
in `SEAWEEDFS_S3_ACCESS_KEY` / `SEAWEEDFS_S3_SECRET_KEY`; the compose file mounts it
read-only. The S3 port (`8333`) is **not** published to the host — only the `hivemem`
service reaches it over the compose network. For ad-hoc inspection use `docker exec`
inside a container on `hivemem-net`, or temporarily publish the port.

> **Note:** The S3 client runs with `chunkedEncodingEnabled(false)`. SeaweedFS does not decode SigV4 streaming (`aws-chunked`) request bodies, so the AWS SDK's default chunked signing would otherwise bake the chunk framing into the stored object and corrupt every JPEG/PDF. Do not re-enable it.

### Repairing aws-chunked-corrupted objects

Objects uploaded before the `chunkedEncodingEnabled(false)` fix carry the `aws-chunked` framing inside the stored bytes (thumbnails render black, PDFs won't open). Repair them once, **after** deploying the fixed image, with an admin token:

```bash
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  https://<host>/admin/attachments/repair-chunked
# → {"scanned":N,"repaired_originals":x,"repaired_thumbnails":y,"failed":0}
```

The sweep is idempotent — it detects and skips already-clean objects, so it is safe to re-run.

## Consumption (Bulk Import)

Drop scan files (PDF, images) into the consumption watch directory. The pipeline picks them up automatically.

### Page limit

PDFs larger than `hivemem.consumption.max-pages` (default 200) are moved straight to `failed/` at intake. Split oversized PDFs before dropping them in.

### Automatic recovery

The `ConsumptionRecoverySweep` runs at startup and every 5 minutes (configurable). It handles two failure modes without operator action:

- **Crash-stranded files** — files whose ledger row is still `processing` past `hivemem.consumption.recovery-stale-threshold` (default 30 min) are re-staged automatically. This covers files that were mid-ingest when the container was restarted.
- **Failed files** — files in `failed/` are moved back to the watch root and retried as long as their attempt count is below `hivemem.consumption.failed-retry-limit` (default 3). Files that exhaust the retry limit remain in `failed/` for manual inspection.

### Embedding backfill

If the embedding service is unavailable when a cell is committed, the cell is tagged `embedding_pending` and committed without a vector. `EmbeddingBackfillService` finds all such cells every `hivemem.embedding.backfill-interval-ms` (default 5 min) and backfills their embeddings once the service recovers. Semantic search is restored within one backfill cycle — no operator action needed.

### Verifying completeness

After a bulk import, check the ledger and the `failed/` directory:

```sql
-- All files should be 'done'; any 'failed' or 'processing' rows need attention
SELECT state, count(*) FROM consumption_file GROUP BY state;
```

```bash
# Inspect any terminally failed files
ls /path/to/consumption/failed/
```

For embedding coverage, count cells with the `embedding_pending` tag — it should drop to zero within one backfill cycle after the embedding service is healthy.

### Configuration

| Property | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `hivemem.consumption.recovery-interval` | `5m` | How often the recovery sweep runs |
| `hivemem.consumption.recovery-stale-threshold` | `30m` | How long a `processing` ledger row must be stale before it is re-staged |
| `hivemem.consumption.failed-retry-limit` | `3` | Max retry attempts for files in `failed/` before they are left there permanently |
| `hivemem.embedding.timeout` | `30s` | HTTP timeout per embedding request |
| `hivemem.embedding.max-retries` | `3` | Retry attempts before the embedding request is abandoned |
| `hivemem.embedding.retry-backoff-ms` | `500` | Base backoff (ms, exponential) between embedding retries |
| `hivemem.embedding.backfill-interval-ms` | `300000` | How often the embedding backfill sweep runs (ms) |
| `hivemem.embedding.backfill-batch-size` | `50` | Max cells processed per backfill sweep |

## Debugging

```bash
docker logs hivemem --tail 50  # Container logs
```

### Re-scanning the same document

A physical re-scan produces different bytes (so SHA-256 dedup does not catch it), but the content dedup discards the new copy and keeps the original (a `duplicate_of` tunnel records the link; the discarded cell is soft-deleted, its unique S3 object removed). Dedup runs once the cell's embedding exists: for short documents (≤500 chars) that is at OCR time, but long OCR'd documents are embedded only after the summarizer produces a summary, so for those dedup runs in the scheduled summarizer (every 5 min) — a re-scan of a long document is therefore deduped on the next summarizer cycle, not instantly. Only `consumption:`-sourced cells are ever discarded. If legitimately distinct documents are being merged, raise `hivemem.consumption.dedup.text-threshold` (and/or `recall-threshold`); to turn the feature off set `hivemem.consumption.dedup.enabled=false`.

### Self-healing embedding backfill

On startup, any live committed cell with a NULL embedding and content longer than 500 characters is tagged `needs_summary`; the scheduled summarizer (every 5 min) then generates its summary and re-embeds it. This is automatic and idempotent — no operator action is needed. It restores semantic search for scans that previously missed their embedding (long OCR'd documents are embedded only after summarization).

### Retro-dedup of existing scans

`POST /admin/dedup-backfill` walks existing live `consumption:`-sourced cells oldest→newest and discards re-scans (same soft-delete + `duplicate_of` tunnel + S3 cleanup as live dedup). Run it **only after embeddings have been backfilled** — give the startup `needs_summary` tagging plus at least one 5-min summarizer cycle to embed the long scans first, otherwise they have no embedding to match on. This is a production write — get explicit authorization before running it.

```bash
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  https://<host>/admin/dedup-backfill
# → {"checked":N,"discarded":x}
```

## Queen + Bees on Vistierie (the LXC host)

### Prerequisites

HiveMem and Vistierie must share the external `hivemem-net` Docker network. This network is already used for summarizer and vision LLM calls, so no additional network configuration is needed.

HiveMem authenticates to Vistierie as tenant `hivemem` using the existing `HIVEMEM_VISTIERIE_TOKEN`. Reuse that token — no new Vistierie credential is needed for Queen/Bee registration.

### 1 — Set Vistierie budgets (mandatory)

Budgets are required. Without them, every cron tick from Vistierie returns 403 and the Queen never runs.

```bash
# Set tenant-level budget
curl -X PATCH http://vistierie:8090/admin/tenants/hivemem/budget \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $VISTIERIE_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"daily_cap_micros":2000000,"monthly_cap_micros":20000000}'

# Set per-agent budgets for both agents
for a in queen isolated-cell-bee; do
  curl -X PATCH http://vistierie:8090/admin/tenants/hivemem/agents/$a/budget \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $VISTIERIE_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
    -H 'content-type: application/json' \
    -d '{"daily_cap_micros":1000000,"monthly_cap_micros":10000000}'
done
```

### 2 — Enable the Queen in HiveMem

Add the following environment variables to your HiveMem deployment and restart the container. On startup HiveMem registers `isolated-cell-bee` and then `queen` in Vistierie (idempotent; safe to restart at any time).

```
HIVEMEM_QUEEN_ENABLED=true
HIVEMEM_QUEEN_HIVEMEM_BASE_URL=http://hivemem:8421
HIVEMEM_QUEEN_WEBHOOK_TOKEN=<strong random token>
HIVEMEM_QUEEN_COMPLETION_WEBHOOK_TOKEN=<second strong random token>
HIVEMEM_QUEEN_SCHEDULE=0 0 3 * * *
```

Use distinct, independently-rotatable tokens for `HIVEMEM_QUEEN_WEBHOOK_TOKEN` (read-only tool webhooks) and `HIVEMEM_QUEEN_COMPLETION_WEBHOOK_TOKEN` (result ingestion).

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `HIVEMEM_QUEEN_ENABLED` | Yes | Set to `true` to activate Queen + Bee registration on startup |
| `HIVEMEM_QUEEN_HIVEMEM_BASE_URL` | Yes | Base URL HiveMem advertises to Vistierie for webhook callbacks |
| `HIVEMEM_QUEEN_WEBHOOK_TOKEN` | Yes | Bearer token for read-only tool webhooks (`/vistierie/tools/**`) |
| `HIVEMEM_QUEEN_COMPLETION_WEBHOOK_TOKEN` | Yes | Bearer token for result ingestion (`/vistierie/runs/done`) |
| `HIVEMEM_QUEEN_SCHEDULE` | Yes | Cron expression controlling how often the Queen runs (e.g. `0 0 3 * * *`) |
| `HIVEMEM_QUEEN_VISTIERIE_ADMIN_TOKEN` | No | Vistierie admin token. When set, the Queen-Log UI shows per-run cost + LLM-call counts via `GET /admin/runs`. Unset → cost columns hidden (falls back to tenant `GET /runs`, no cost data). |

### 3 — Verify registration

```bash
curl http://vistierie:8090/agents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HIVEMEM_VISTIERIE_TOKEN"
```

Expect the response to include entries for `isolated-cell-bee` and `queen`.

### 4 — Optional smoke test (manual trigger)

```bash
curl -X POST http://vistierie:8090/agents/queen/run \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HIVEMEM_VISTIERIE_TOKEN" \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"payload":{}}'
```

Then check HiveMem's pending approvals (`approve_pending` MCP tool or the admin UI) for new `pending` tunnel proposals from the Bee.

### Kill switch

To halt all Queen and Bee activity immediately:

```bash
curl -X POST http://vistierie:8090/admin/tenants/hivemem/kill \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $VISTIERIE_ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

Re-enable by removing the kill flag via the Vistierie admin API, then restarting HiveMem (re-registration is idempotent).
